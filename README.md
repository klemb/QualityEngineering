## What is Quality Engineering?
Software Quality Engineering (SQE) is the discipline of ensuring that software meets the required quality standards through a comprehensive set of processes and techniques. SQE involves activities such as quality planning, quality control, and quality assurance, all of which aim to ensure that the software product is of high quality and meets customer requirements.
SQE differs from Test Engineering in that while both disciplines focus on quality, test engineering specifically deals with the creation and execution of tests to verify that the software meets the specified requirements. Test engineers are responsible for designing and executing test cases to validate the software's functionality, reliability, and performance. They also work to identify defects and issues and report them back to the development team for fixing.
On the other hand, SQE encompasses a broader set of activities, including developing quality standards and processes, monitoring and improving the software development life cycle, ensuring that the software meets the required quality standards, and verifying that the software has been adequately tested. SQE professionals also work to establish metrics to measure and improve the overall quality of the software product.
Software Quality Engineering (SQE) as a discipline has evolved over time and its origins can be traced back to the early days of software development. The need for SQE arose as software became more complex and the demand for high-quality software increased.
In the early days of software development, there was a lack of attention to quality, and testing was often an afterthought. It was only in the 1970s, with the development of structured programming and software engineering practices, that SQE began to emerge as a distinct discipline.
The concept of SQE was formalized in the 1980s with the development of quality management standards such as ISO 9000. These standards provided a framework for managing quality across all stages of the software development life cycle.
Since then, SQE has continued to evolve as software development practices have become more sophisticated, and new tools and techniques for managing quality have been developed. Today, SQE is an established discipline with a broad range of practices and techniques aimed at ensuring that software products meet the required quality standards.
